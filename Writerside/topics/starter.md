# Overview

It's not every day that you can work with top computation software and the people who created it. How can I advance my career in power systems? Wolfram Summer School will match my computational projects with experts.

## Power System Tools

You must match generation with load. The spatially closer the simpler! As you move to more economical load-generation matching, the system becomes more complex. Things like time-shifting both load and generation have real benefits. Brute forces measures such as nuclear generation are still possible, but waste, risk, and environmental impact have to be weighed. The tools have be understandable, nimble and comprehensive.

## Glossary

A definition list or a glossary:

Bus-Branch system (Bus system)
: A junction point in an electrical network where multiple circuits come together. It is used to connect different parts of the electrical system, such as generators, transformers, and loads, and to allow the flow of electricity between them.

Node-breaker system
: Adds interruption and switching into the bus system which isolates faults and maintains service. The model is much closer to the actual system.
